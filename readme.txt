Convert Azerbaijani and Russian characters in slugs and filenames to Latin for SEO-friendly and readable permalinks.

== Description ==

AZRULAT is a lightweight free WordPress plugin that transliterates Azerbaijani and Russian characters into Latin equivalents, ensuring clean, SEO-optimized, and readable slugs and filenames. It also removes unwanted symbols, special punctuation, and excessive whitespace.

This plugin works automatically and is particularly beneficial for websites targeting Azerbaijani and Russian-speaking audiences. It helps improve search engine indexing and user-friendly URLs.

== Features ==

1. **Transliteration of Azerbaijani Characters**  
   Converts Azerbaijani-specific letters into Latin equivalents:  
   - `ə` → `e`  
   - `ü` → `u`  
   - `ı` → `i`  
   - `ç` → `c`  
   - `ş` → `s`  
   - `ğ` → `g`  
   - `Ə` → `E`, `Ü` → `U`, `İ` → `I`, `Ç` → `C`, `Ş` → `S`, `Ğ` → `G`  

2. **Transliteration of Russian Cyrillic Characters**  
   Converts Russian Cyrillic letters to Latin equivalents:  
   - Examples:  
     - `А` → `A`, `а` → `a`  
     - `Б` → `B`, `б` → `b`  
     - `В` → `V`, `в` → `v`  
     - `Ж` → `Zh`, `ж` → `zh`  
     - `Ч` → `Ch`, `ч` → `ch`

3. **Special Characters and Symbols**  
   Replaces or removes non-URL-safe characters, ensuring clean slugs:  
   - Converts spaces to hyphens (`-`).  
   - Removes non-ASCII characters not defined in the transliteration table.  
   - Replaces multiple hyphens with a single hyphen.  

4. **Filename Sanitization**  
   Ensures uploaded file names are transliterated and cleaned, following the same rules as post slugs.

   - Post titles (slugs).  
   - Term names.  
   - Uploaded filenames.

== Example ==

**Output Slug**: `azerbaycan-ve-russkiy-yazyk-2024`  

**Input Title**: `Ağ rəngli kağız — alarsan`  
**Output Slug**: `ag-rengli-kagiz-alarsan`
